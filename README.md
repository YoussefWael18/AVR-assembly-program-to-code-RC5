# RC5 Encryption Implementation
**Status**: In Progress  
This project implements RC5 encryption in AVR assembly on an Arduino Uno, with input/output via PuTTY. Currently developing key expansion and rotation routines.  
## Features (Planned)
- 16-bit word size with 8 rounds
- Serial communication for plaintext and key input
- Optimized for ATmega328P microcontroller
